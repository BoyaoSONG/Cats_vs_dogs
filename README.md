# Cats_vs_dogs
First time self-study deep learning
<br>This repository is a notebook for my first time self-learn deep learning.</br>
Follow tutorials from internet and read others notes. Finally I can build my own neural network and the I am very satisfied with the results and accuracy I got.</br>
Dataset from Kaggle.</br>
This repository contains: </br>
	1. Practice depp learning with Tensorflow directly.</br>
	2. Practice deep learning with Kears, which is use Tensorflow as back-end. </br>
	3. The best result I got is in Python program:kaopu_keras_model_for_catsdogs.py.</br>
